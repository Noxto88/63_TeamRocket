We have a "no questions asked return at delivery and refund policy" which entitles all our members to return the product at the time of delivery if due to some reason they are not satisfied with the products delivered. We will take the returned product back with us and issue a credit note for the value of the returned products which will be credited to your account on TeamRocket. This can be used to pay for your subsequent shopping bills.
Acceptance of returns & refund post delivery is subject to a satisfactory inspection by our customer service team. Please get in touch with us via self-service on the bigbasket app or call on 1860 123 1000 for any such requests.


If you receive a damaged or otherwise unusable grocery item, you can request a refund we wonâ€™t ask you to return the item. Follow the on-screen instructions and select Refund when prompted.
